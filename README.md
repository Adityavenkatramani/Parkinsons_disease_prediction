# Parkinson's Disease Prediction

This project aims to predict Parkinson's disease based on a dataset containing various voice measurements. It utilizes the Logistic Regression algorithm for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in the file "parkinsons.data". It contains information about voice measurements of individuals, including features such as fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonics ratio, and others.

The dataset consists of 195 instances and 23 input features, with the target variable being the presence or absence of Parkinson's disease (1: Parkinson's, 0: No Parkinson's).

## Requirements

To run the code, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Instructions

1. Download the code and dataset files.

2. Open the code in a Python development environment or Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run the code to train the Logistic Regression model and evaluate its performance.

4. The accuracy of the model on both the training and testing datasets will be displayed.

5. You can also provide custom input values to predict whether a person has Parkinson's disease or not.

## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 87% on the training dataset and 84% on the testing dataset.
